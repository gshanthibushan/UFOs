# UFOs
The purpose of this project to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.

## Overview of Project:
For this project we are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. We want to use filters since we have many different sightings that occurred throughout the U.S.-- based on the different areas or what type of shape of the sighting.
